This is the Java client for the Meplato Store 2 API. It helps you write
software to integrate into the Meplato suite for suppliers.

## Prerequisites

You need at two things to use the Meplato Store 2 API.

1. A login to Meplato Store 2.
2. An API token.

Get your login by contacting Meplato Supplier Network Services. The API token
is required to securely communicate with the Meplato Store 2 API. You can
find it in the personalization section when logged into Meplato Store.

## Getting started

All functionality in the client is separated into services. So you first
need to create and initialize a service, then set its parameters, and finally
execute it. Here's an example of how to retrieve the list of catalogs for
your Meplato Store account.

```java
import com.meplato.store2.ApacheHttpClient;
import com.meplato.store2.Client;
import com.meplato.store2.ServiceException;
import com.meplato.store2.catalogs.Service;
import com.meplato.store2.catalogs.SearchResponse;
import com.meplato.store2.catalogs.Catalog;

...

// Client is the HTTP Client to use for making HTTP requests.
// The package comes with a default implementation (ApacheHttpClient),
// but feel free to create your own.
Client client = new ApacheHttpClient();

// Instantiate the Catalogs service and set your API token.
Service service = new Service(client);
service.setUser("<your-api-token>");

// Create a search, execute it, and iterate through the results.
SearchResponse response = service.search().skip(0).take(10).sort("-created,name").execute();
System.out.format("You have %d catalog(s).\n", response.getTotalItems());
for (Catalog catalog : response.getItems()) {
    System.out.format("Catalog with ID=%d has name %s.\n", catalog.getId(), catalog.getName());
}
```

Feel free to look at the unit tests to get further information on how to use the services.
